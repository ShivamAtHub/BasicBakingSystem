## Description
- This is a Web Development project for The Sparks Foundation GRIP Internship of April 2023.
- The website in this project is also Responsive, it means it can run on any browser and also it is mobile/tablet compatible.
- This project includes 2 main tables 'customer' and 'transaction' which contain their respective details.
- I also have included all the images used in this project. (you can change them according to your preference)

## Requirements
- This project can be edited on any IDE, I created it using Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- This project was made with the help of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (5.3), MySQL, PHP.
- You will also need XAMPP installed on your computer for Apache & MySQL modules.
